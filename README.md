## Kuaray project Sensors test script
This is a very basic script to test the 3 sensors used by Project Kuaray:
* Air quality sensor (MQ135);
* Air humidity sensor (DHT22);
* Air temperature sensor (DHT22).

## Installation
Clone this repository or download a zip file. Later on, we'll publish it to NPM.
To run this program, you must have a Raspberry PI 3, running Ubuntu, with Node.js installed.
Run the command: 
`sudo npm install`

## Running the program

The script takes one parameter, which is the number of interactions between measurements. If you want to run it forever, use 0 (zero).
`sudo node teste1 <iterations>``
